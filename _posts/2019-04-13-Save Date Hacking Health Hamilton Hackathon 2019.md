Save your date for Hacking Health Hamilton Hackathon 2019 (Nov 8- Nov 10).

### Description
Pitch ideas, form teams, get advice from experts, and build a useable solution to address the users' problems over the course of a weekend. Sunday afternoon demo your solution in front of a panel of judges for a chance of winning some fantastic prizes!

Hacking Health fosters collaborative innovation by engaging key groups of stakeholders, such as healthcare professionals, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and patients, to create human-centric solutions to improve the health of our communities. Our weekend hackathons are fun, intense, hands-on events where small teams tackle tough problems in a supportive community of peers and mentors.
