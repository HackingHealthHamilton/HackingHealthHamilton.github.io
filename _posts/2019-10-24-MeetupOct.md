Value Stream Mapping is a way to approach your innovation, like Design Thinking, that will help you to find the point of highest leverage where your project can make the biggest change in a system. Specifically, it helps you to find the part of a process, like the delivery of a specific kind of healthcare, where things break down, are slow, inefficient, and then how to inject your innovation to achieve a big improvement.
