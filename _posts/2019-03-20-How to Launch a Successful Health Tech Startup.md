### Details
On Wednesday, March 20, Hacking Health Hamilton presents How to Launch a Successful Health Tech Startup: Get advice from two health tech entrepreneurs from Toronto, an informative and interactive free meetup at [CoMotion On King](http://www.comotiongroup.ca/comotion-on-king/) in Downtown Hamilton.

We will have founders of two health tech companies discuss their projects and their experience as healthcare entrepreneurs.

**Taylan Pince**, CTO and Co-Founder of [Avocare](https://avocare.ca/), is an experienced technology leader, having built a development firm with over $3M in annual revenue. He has led app development for Robinhood, Muse and blogTO. Taylan values great user experiences in digital, with meaningful engagement for users. After building an EMR and coming from a family of doctors himself, building Avocare was a natural choice.

[Avocare](www.avocare.ca) lets patients send and receive secure messages with their own clinic and doctor, bringing the convenience of instant messaging to healthcare providers.

Prior to co-founding HealthCasa, Dr. **Karen Klein**, CEO at [HealthCasa Limited](https://www.healthcasa.com/), worked as a dentist in Johannesburg, South Africa. However, she soon came to the realization that practicing dentistry was not her passion, and she believes strongly that success is fueled by passion. Moving to, and living in downtown Toronto, sheâ€™s become accustomed to the ever-growing variety of on-demand services, that just seems to make life that much simpler. But, she has found the healthcare sector struggling to catch up.

[HealthCasa](www.healthcasa.com) is the only on-demand service that allows you to book an appointment online through a LIVE, REAL-TIME appointment booking portal, with a practitioner of your choice, at the location of your choice, and on a day and time that is convenient for YOU!

About the Venue

[CoMotion On King](http://www.comotiongroup.ca/comotion-on-king/) is a co-working initiative and Hamilton's largest co-working space in the heart of downtown.
