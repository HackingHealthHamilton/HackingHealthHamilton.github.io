<p>Hacking Health fosters collaborative innovation by engaging key groups of stakeholders, such as healthcare professionals, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and patients, to create human-centric solutions to improve the health of our communities. Our weekend hackathons are fun, intense, hands-on events where small teams tackle tough problems in a supportive community of peers and mentors.</p>
<p>Hackathon 2018 will centre around <strong>Transforming the Aging Experience through Innovation</strong>. During the weekend hackathon, let's discover opportunities and build solutions that transform aging and improve the quality of life and health of our aging population.</p>

<h2><span>PARTICIPATE</span></h2>
<h3><span>Pitch Your Ideas on Sparkboard</span></h3>
<p><span>As soon as you get you register for the hackathon, go to&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://hhhamilton2018.sparkboard.com/" target="_blank">Hacking Health Hamilton 2018 Sparkboard</a>&nbsp;</span><span>where you can either pitch your project ideas, describing them briefly and their skill requirements (designer, developer, medical expert, etc), or find a pitch/project idea that interests you or that matches your skills.</span></p>
<p><span>With this year's theme centred around aging consider: independence; mobility; staying connected with family, friends and community; managing chronic illnesses while remaining active. &nbsp;Have other ideas? Great! Ideas not related to aging? That's ok too! &nbsp;Pitch as many ideas as you like.</span></p>
<p>See a pitch/project idea that interests you or that matches your skills? Click on the board for further details and click on the Join button near the bottom to support the idea. &nbsp;Joining a project does not automatically assign you to that team, but shows your interest in the idea. (Teams are created on Friday evening of the Hackathon when you choose, after the pitches, which team you would like to work with.)</p>
