The program selects high potential teams of McMaster graduate, professional, and undergraduate students and puts them through a week-long design sprint in the alpha phase of the program. Teams are then selected to move to the beta phase where they spend ~3 weeks turning their idea into the prototype with mentorship from a wide variety of entrepreneurs and professionals. Zehong will overview the Genesis program experience!
