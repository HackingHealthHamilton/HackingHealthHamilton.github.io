### Details

On April 11, [The Mohawk College Cyber Security Club](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/about-mohawk/cyber-security/cyber-security-club) hosted Hacking Health Hamilton April Meetup in Mohawk College.

Dr. Karen Klein and Taylan Pince shared how they built two incredible startups from the ground up - and the impact they have had.

We met with **Dr. Karen Klein** and **Taylan Pince**, two Toronto healthtech founders who shared their story on how they transformed an idea they were passionate about into two full-scale organizations that help patients daily.

Dr. Klein, Dentist, Co-founder, and CEO of [HealthCasa](https://www.healthcasa.com/), shared how it all started with one frustrating experience trying to find a physiotherapist. Building over her own clinical experience, she promptly developed an in-home appointment platform that makes getting a physiotherapist that much simpler. She also explained the awesome support she has received from the tech community - “you can’t keep up with it”. 

> "It was such a frustrating process- I couldn’t understand how there wasn’t an easier way!" **-Dr. Klein**

Taylan also shared some of his struggles and successes as founder and CEO of [Avocare](https://avocare.ca/) with us. He suggests we start by paying attention and understanding what our users need: for him, this meant looking how doctors work, understanding their needs, and really hearing them and grasping their grievances. By immersing himself in the field, he developed a solution that helps doctors communicate with their patients, without impacting their own practice.

> "It always goes back to your first users and first product: understand their grievances of end users. I would just go and watch them work for weeks." **-Taylan Pince**

But there is also value in taking a big step away: eventually, you have to look at everything running together, trust your team and letting them learn on their own.
