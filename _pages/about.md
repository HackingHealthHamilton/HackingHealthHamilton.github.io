# About Hacking Health Hamilton

Hacking Health Hamilton is a digital health innovation organization, part of a global movement of grassroots groups in more than 40 cities around the world — Canada, US, Europe, Australia, Asia, even South Africa and Tunisia.

We bring together three groups: health care practitioners, entrepreneurs and innovators, designers and tech developers.

We run open meetup “Cafés” regularly throughout the year, bringing in exciting healthcare innovators to tell their stories and show their work. We encourage interaction and discussion, and we run an annual hackathon in Hamilton. Our hackathon runs over a weekend and allows innovators, both neophyte and experienced, to create prototypes and compete for prizes such as valuable support from local organizations.

Together, we're hacking healthcare in Hamilton!
